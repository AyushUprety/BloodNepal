			Blood Transfusion Service of Nepal Red Cross Society was established in the year 1966 i.e. 3 years after the inception of the Society itself. In the initial years the service was made possible through collection of blood from professional donors but since 1982 collection of blood was emphasized from voluntary non remunerated donors only. <br><br>Today, blood is collected mostly from these sectors through routine motivational and collection campaigns but motivated individuals are also significant donors. The blood collection mobile teams routinely visit these institutions in the valley and in the outskirts of Kathmandu Valley to collect blood.
